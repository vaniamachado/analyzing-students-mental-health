### 📍 Overview

## Project Objective
Explore mental health patterns among students at a Japanese university, focusing on:
1. Differences between international and domestic students.
2. Impact of social connectedness and acculturative stress on depression.
3. Effect of length of stay in Japan on mental health outcomes.

**Dataset Overview**


 - 268 student records; 75% international, 92% undergraduates.

 - Highlights the importance of focusing on international students’ well-being.

## Key Findings

1. **Depression Prevalence**

International students: 37.8% depressed (~8% higher)

Domestic students: 29.9% depressed 

Female international students show the highest risk (39.8% vs 34.2% for males).

2. **Psychological Scores**

   - Average PHQ scores indicate similar depression levels between international and domestic students.
   - Social connectedness (SCS) is variable, highlighting potential differences in support networks.
   - Acculturative stress (AS) is moderately high in international students, consistent with adaptation challenges.

3. **Length of Stay**

No clear linear trend; depression peaks among 3rd-year international students (Todep = 9.09), possibly due to mid-term adaptation and academic pressures.

4. **Social Support & Correlations**
    - Negative correlations with friends (-0.12) and parents (-0.21) indicate that higher support from these sources is associated with lower depression scores. These findings highlight the protective role of personal social networks for mental health.
  
5. **Predictors of Depression**
The regression analysis shows that higher acculturative stress increases depression scores  among international students. Support from friends reduces depression risk, while higher parental support may reflect students already experiencing difficulties. Universities should focus on peer-support programs and early interventions, especially for first-year international students, to enhance adaptation and mental well-being.
