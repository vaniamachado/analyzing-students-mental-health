### 📍 Overview

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

### 🎯 Objectives

Explore mental health patterns among students at a Japanese university, focusing on:  
1. **Differences** between international and domestic students.  
2. **Impact** of social connectedness and acculturative stress on depression.  
3. **Effect** of length of stay in Japan on mental health outcomes.

### Dataset Overview

- 268 student records; 75% international.  
- Gender distribution: 170 female (63.4%), 98 male (36.6%).  
- Academic level: 92% undergraduates; freshmen represent the largest group (42.9%).  
- Highlights the importance of focusing on international students’ well-being.

### Key Findings

1. **Depression Prevalence**  
   - International students: 37.8% depressed (~8% higher than domestic students).  
   - Domestic students: 29.9% depressed.  
   - Female international students show the highest risk (39.8% vs 34.2% for males).

2. **Psychological Scores and Correlations**  
   - Average PHQ scores indicate **similar depression levels** between international and domestic students.  
   - **Social connectedness (SCS)** shows a moderate negative correlation with depression (r = -0.54), indicating that higher social integration is linked to lower depressive symptoms.  
   - **Acculturative stress (AS)** shows a moderate positive correlation with depression (r = 0.41), suggesting that greater adaptation challenges are associated with higher depressive symptoms.  
   - AS is moderately high among international students, consistent with adaptation challenges.  
   - These results highlight the importance of fostering social support networks and helping students manage adaptation stress.

3. **Length of Stay**  
   - Depression peaks in 3rd-year international students (average PHQ = 9.09), suggesting mid-term adaptation challenges and academic pressures.

4. **Predictors of Depression**  
   - Among international students, the only socio-demographic factor significantly associated with depression is **length of stay**.  
   - Peer support, social integration, and managing acculturative stress are key factors for mental well-being.

### Implications
- Universities should implement **peer-support programs** and **early intervention initiatives**, especially for first-year international students, to enhance adaptation and mental health.
